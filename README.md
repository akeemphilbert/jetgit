- **Utils**: Helper functions and utilities

### Key Components
- `GitService`: Core Git operations using VS Code's Git API
- `GitMenuController`: Manages the main Git menu and branch hierarchy
- `ContextMenuProvider`: Handles right-click context menu integration
- `DiffViewer`: Custom webview-based diff interface
- `ConflictResolver`: Automatic and manual conflict resolution

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Git Menu Not Showing
- **Cause**: No Git repository detected
- **Solution**: Ensure you have a Git repository open in your workspace

#### Commands Not Working
- **Cause**: Extension not properly activated
- **Solution**: Reload VS Code window (`Ctrl+Shift+P` ‚Üí "Developer: Reload Window")

#### Diff Viewer Not Opening
- **Cause**: File not tracked by Git or no differences found
- **Solution**: Ensure the file is tracked and has changes to compare

#### Performance Issues with Large Repositories
- **Cause**: Large number of branches or extensive history
- **Solution**: JetGit is optimized for large repositories, but you can:
  - Use `git config core.preloadindex true` for faster operations
  - Consider using shallow clones for very large repositories

### Getting Help
1. Check the [Troubleshooting Guide](#troubleshooting)
2. Search existing [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/your-username/jetgit/issues)
3. Create a new issue with:
   - VS Code version
   - JetGit version
   - Operating system
   - Steps to reproduce
