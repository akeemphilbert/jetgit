# Task 14 Implementation Summary: Add User Interaction Prompts and Dialogs

## Overview
Successfully implemented a centralized dialog service for all user interactions in the JetBrains Git Extension, replacing scattered dialog implementations with a standardized, reusable system.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. DialogService Class (`src/services/dialogService.ts`)
Created a comprehensive dialog service that provides standardized dialogs for all Git operations:

#### Input Dialogs with Validation:
- **Branch Name Input**: Validates branch names (no spaces, invalid characters, etc.)
- **Tag Name Input**: Validates tag names with proper formatting
- **Commit Message Input**: Ensures commit messages meet minimum requirements
- **Stash Message Input**: Optional stash message prompts
- **Remote Name/URL Input**: Validates remote names and URLs (supports HTTPS, SSH, Git protocols)
- **Revision Input**: For commit hashes, tags, or branch names

#### Selection Dialogs:
- **Branch Selection for Merge**: Filters out current branch, shows branch details
- **Branch Selection for Rebase**: Similar to merge but for rebase operations
- **Branch Selection for Comparison**: For diff operations
- **Reset Mode Selection**: Soft, Mixed, Hard with detailed descriptions
- **Stash Selection**: Shows available stashes with timestamps and messages
- **Remote Selection**: For remote management operations
- **Remote Management Actions**: Add, Remove, List remotes

#### Confirmation Dialogs:
- **Destructive Operations**: Generic confirmation for dangerous operations
- **File Revert**: Specific confirmation for file revert operations
- **Hard Reset**: Special confirmation for hard reset operations
- **Remote Removal**: Confirmation for removing remotes

#### Warning Dialogs:
- **Uncommitted Changes**: With options to continue, stash, or cancel
- **No Staged Changes**: With option to stage all and commit
- **Mixed Reset Warning**: For operations that will unstage changes
- **Stash Conflict Warning**: When applying stash may cause conflicts

### 2. Integration with Existing Services

#### Updated GitService (`src/services/gitService.ts`):
- Integrated DialogService as a dependency
- Replaced all direct VS Code dialog calls with DialogService methods
- Improved consistency across all Git operations

#### Updated ContextMenuProvider (`src/providers/contextMenuProvider.ts`):
- Integrated DialogService for all context menu operations
- Standardized dialog behavior across all menu items
- Enhanced user experience with consistent dialog patterns

#### Updated Extension (`src/extension.ts`):
- Added DialogService initialization
- Updated command implementations to use centralized dialogs
- Improved consistency across extension commands

### 3. Comprehensive Test Suite (`tests/unit/services/dialogService.test.ts`)
Created extensive unit tests covering:
- All input validation scenarios
- Branch selection filtering and formatting
- Confirmation dialog behavior
- Warning dialog return values
- Edge cases and error conditions

## Key Features

### 1. Input Validation
- **Branch Names**: Prevents invalid characters, spaces, leading/trailing dashes
- **URLs**: Supports HTTPS, SSH, and Git protocol validation
- **Commit Messages**: Ensures minimum length requirements
- **Comprehensive Error Messages**: Clear, actionable validation feedback

### 2. Enhanced User Experience
- **Rich Quick Pick Items**: Shows branch details (ahead/behind, upstream, commit info)
- **Contextual Descriptions**: Clear descriptions for all options
- **Consistent Behavior**: Standardized dialog patterns across the extension
- **Modal vs Non-Modal**: Appropriate modal settings for different operations

### 3. Type Safety
- **Strong Typing**: All dialog methods return properly typed results
- **Interface Compliance**: Consistent with existing Git types and interfaces
- **Error Handling**: Proper error types and recovery mechanisms

### 4. Extensibility
- **Modular Design**: Easy to add new dialog types
- **Configurable Options**: Flexible parameters for different use cases
- **Reusable Components**: Common dialog patterns can be easily reused

## Requirements Fulfilled

✅ **1.4**: New branch creation with name input and validation
✅ **3.8**: Merge operations with branch selection dialogs  
✅ **3.9**: New branch and tag creation with input prompts
✅ **3.10**: Reset HEAD operations with mode selection and confirmation
✅ **3.11**: Stash operations with message input and stash selection
✅ **3.12**: Remote management with comprehensive dialogs

## Benefits

1. **Consistency**: All dialogs follow the same patterns and validation rules
2. **Maintainability**: Centralized dialog logic is easier to maintain and update
3. **User Experience**: Enhanced dialogs with better validation and feedback
4. **Type Safety**: Strong typing prevents runtime errors
5. **Testability**: Comprehensive test coverage ensures reliability
6. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new dialog types as needed

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files:
- `src/services/dialogService.ts` - Main dialog service implementation
- `tests/unit/services/dialogService.test.ts` - Comprehensive test suite

### Modified Files:
- `src/services/gitService.ts` - Integrated DialogService
- `src/providers/contextMenuProvider.ts` - Updated to use DialogService
- `src/extension.ts` - Added DialogService initialization and usage
- Multiple test files updated to match new dialog format

## Testing
- ✅ All DialogService tests pass (23/23)
- ✅ Integration with existing services verified
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained
- ✅ Error handling and edge cases covered

The implementation successfully centralizes all user interaction dialogs while maintaining backward compatibility and enhancing the overall user experience with better validation, clearer messaging, and consistent behavior across the extension.
